# SM-Chat

## ❓Introduction

This is my course design in cryptographic engineering. The full name of this project is called **secure instant messaging software based on SM algorithm family**. This project is based on [UChat](https://github.com/Leeyuxun/UChat), which was completed three years ago. 

This project fixes the bugs in UChat and removes some imperfect functions. In this project, `AES`, `MD5` and other encryption algorithms are replaced with `SM algorithms`.

The main language of the project is `Python`.  The project uses `SQLite` database and `Tkinter` to write graphical interface.

## 🛠️How to use

>   The python version of this project is 3.7+

```shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
python server_run.py
python client_run.py 
```
